Extending a series of filing and other deadlines to assist the oil and gas sector in stabilizing operations, as their employees transition to working from home.  These extensions do not impact health or environmental safety and apply to routine reporting activities, which will be addressed when the sector returns to normal operations.
Extending mineral rights, scheduled to expire in 2020, by one year.  This includes rights granted under the terms of an oil and gas lease, exploration license or permit.  The extension will provide oil and gas disposition holders with the time necessary to properly evaluate their properties once the current situation stabilizes.
Reducing the industry portion of the Oil and Gas Administrative Levy by 50 per cent this fiscal year and delaying the invoicing of the remaining balance until October 1, 2020.  This will provide the sector with relief of $11.4 million to address immediate liquidity challenges.

The green agreement gives us a way to reach this goal.

According to the Minister of the Environment Rene Koka, the green agreement will bring several opportunities for Estonia. ï¿½It is in our interest to move with innovation and find new perspectives for increasing the competitiveness of Estonian companies, increasing the volume of investments and opportunities for the transition to renewable energy. One important area for Estonia is the development of hydrogen and other renewable energy and fuel-based technologies. In my opinion, hydrogen is definitely one of the solutions of the future, and I believe that in ten years' time, hydrogen solutions could work very successfully both in Estonia and in Europe, ""said Kokk. Estonia supports the establishment of a long-term climate neutrality framework across the European Union in 2050 in European climate law. At the same time, increasing the European Union's 2030 climate target must be preceded by a thorough analysis of Member States and sectors. According to Estonia, the energy and transport sectors need the most investments, as it is important to ensure energy security and security of supply in the transition to climate neutrality. Estonia sees great potential, for example, in offshore wind farms, which is a good opportunity for greater use of renewable energy in the Nordic-Baltic region. There is also a need to support the development of innovative solutions, the development of green technologies and basic and applied research. The focus should also be on the implementation and use of future technologies and the development of the necessary skills. Estonia also emphasizes the importance of environmental education and the fact-based treatment of green issues. Estonia's position also points out that the initial European Green Agreement action plan published in December would also take into account the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. However, exit activities must be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals and the principles of the circular economy. At the moment, the EU and International Co-operation Department of Ministry of Environment of Estonia cannot point to a more detailed action plan.

Experiences from implementing the Satoyama Initiative are clearly the first potential step toward designing a new society post-COVID-19. The idea of ""local production for local consumption"" is based on building 'face-to-face relationships' between producers and consumers, and reevaluating relationships with communities in which we live or to which we have close ties. This is done in practice through the Satoyama Initiative.
The practice of ""local production for local consumption"" will allow people living in the region to rethink their habits and the underlying environment and nurture environmental values. This buildup of value will lead to productive and strong local communities. Furthermore, strong local communities contribute not only to biodiversity conservation, but also various other priorities such as disaster risk reduction. For example, as the climate crisis intensify disasters, it is necessary to build societies that are resilient -- societies that can repair the damage caused and swiftly recover. To do so, strong community ties among residents built over day-to-day life are indispensable, in addition to employing nature-based solutions. To redesign socioeconomic systems through COVID-19 recovery, the three transitions of decarbonization, circular economy, and decentralization are critical.

The plan is one of President Moonï¿½s biggest economic initiatives since coming to power in 2017.

ï¿½ The Korean New Deal will involve a direct investment of KRW 114 trillion from the national treasury by 2025, which with funding from the private sector and local governments will rise to around KRW 160 trillion. Korea commits USD 60.9 billion (KRW 73.4 trillion / EUR 53.4 billion) to Green New Deal by 2025. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Green New Deal would create 659,000 jobs.

ï¿½ Breakdown of the commitment
   1. Green Transition of Infrastructures - Investment of 30.1 trillion won including 12.1 trillion won from the treasury
   2. Low-carbon and decentralized energy supply - Investment of 35.8 trillion won including 24.3 trillion won from the treasury
   3. Innovation in the Green Industry - 7.6 trillion won including 6.3 trillion won from the treasury

ï¿½ The Green New Deal aims to transform the economy from carbon-dependent to a low-carbon one and prepare for the post-COVID-19 era and is supposed to foster the renewable energy sector. South Korea seeks to increase solar and wind capacity to 42.7 gigawatts by 2025, compared with 12.7 gigawatts in 2019. The plan also promises refurbishment of public rental housing and schools to make them zero-energy, and transformation of urban areas into smart green cities.

ï¿½ ï¿½The Green New Deal is about responding preemptively to the climate crisis, a desperate reality already confronting us. The COVID-19 pandemic has reaffirmed the urgency of responding to climate change,ï¿½ President Moon said at the Korean New Deal presentation on 14 July.

KOR12,KOR,Subventions/prêts (y compris les prêts sans intérêt),Other,Industrie,KRW 7.6 trillion,Climate Mitigation,,,"ï¿½ On 14 July 2020, Koreaï¿½s President Moon Jae-in revealed a plan to commit KRW 160 trillion (USD 133 billion) to a ï¿½K-New Dealï¿½, that has new main pillars: the Digital New Deal and Green New Deal. The plan is one of President Moonï¿½s biggest economic initiatives since coming to power in 2017.

ï¿½ The Korean New Deal will involve a direct investment of KRW 114 trillion from the national treasury by 2025, which with funding from the private sector and local governments will rise to around KRW 160 trillion. Korea commits USD 60.9 billion (KRW 73.4 trillion / EUR 53.4 billion) to Green New Deal by 2025. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Green New Deal would create 659,000 jobs.

ï¿½ Breakdown of the commitment
   1. Green Transition of Infrastructures - Investment of 30.1 trillion won including 12.1 trillion won from the treasury
   2. Low-carbon and decentralized energy supply - Investment of 35.8 trillion won including 24.3 trillion won from the treasury
   3. Innovation in the Green Industry - 7.6 trillion one including 6.3 trillion won from the treasury

ï¿½ The Green New Deal aims to transform the economy from carbon-dependent to a low-carbon one and prepare for the post-COVID-19 era and is supposed to foster the renewable energy sector. South Korea seeks to increase solar and wind capacity to 42.7 gigawatts by 2025, compared with 12.7 gigawatts in 2019. The plan also promises refurbishment of public rental housing and schools to make them zero-energy, and transformation of urban areas into smart green cities.

The innovation centers will focus on manufacturing value-added, carbon-based products from coal, as well developing new methods to extract and process rare earth elements and critical minerals from coal. 

DOE anticipates funding innovation centers in a multiple of U.S. coal producing basins. New and existing coalitions of private industry, academia, national laboratories, and state and local governments are encouraged to compete to establish the centers. 

Once established - the public-private innovation centers will research and incubate innovative mining, beneficiation, processing, and purification technologies that are environmentally sustainable.

Treasury Department has released new rules guiding how companies use a federal tax credit designed to spur investment in carbon capture and sequestration projects.

Credits are $50 per metric ton of CO2 for projects that sequester carbon and $35 per ton for projects where carbon is captured and then used for recovering oil underground.

The new rules aim to give investors and developers clearer guidelines for 45Q tax credit program and ensure that projects are capturing and burying the amount of carbon they are supposed to before they embark on the costly projects.

Among the new measures are monitoring requirements for projects to demonstrate durable geologic storage of CO2 injected underground, standards for measuring utilization of carbon and rules for credit recapture.
