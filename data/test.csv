The green agreement gives us a way to reach this goal. It is a framework that covers almost all policy areas, with a strong emphasis on social and economic issues in addition to environmental issues."" According to the Minister of the Environment Rene Koka, the green agreement will bring several opportunities for Estonia. �It is in our interest to move with innovation and find new perspectives for increasing the competitiveness of Estonian companies, increasing the volume of investments and opportunities for the transition to renewable energy. One important area for Estonia is the development of hydrogen and other renewable energy and fuel-based technologies. In my opinion, hydrogen is definitely one of the solutions of the future, and I believe that in ten years' time, hydrogen solutions could work very successfully both in Estonia and in Europe, ""said Kokk. Estonia supports the establishment of a long-term climate neutrality framework across the European Union in 2050 in European climate law. At the same time, increasing the European Union's 2030 climate target must be preceded by a thorough analysis of Member States and sectors. According to Estonia, the energy and transport sectors need the most investments, as it is important to ensure energy security and security of supply in the transition to climate neutrality. Estonia sees great potential, for example, in offshore wind farms, which is a good opportunity for greater use of renewable energy in the Nordic-Baltic region. There is also a need to support the development of innovative solutions, the development of green technologies and basic and applied research. The focus should also be on the implementation and use of future technologies and the development of the necessary skills. Estonia also emphasizes the importance of environmental education and the fact-based treatment of green issues. Estonia's position also points out that the initial European Green Agreement action plan published in December would also take into account the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. However, exit activities must be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals and the principles of the circular economy. At the moment, the EU and International Co-operation Department of Ministry of Environment of Estonia cannot point to a more detailed action plan. There is coherence at EU level and these effects are likely to be taken into account in future legislative proposals.

� The Green New Deal aims to transform the economy from carbon-dependent to a low-carbon one and prepare for the post-COVID-19 era and is supposed to foster the renewable energy sector. South Korea seeks to increase solar and wind capacity to 42.7 gigawatts by 2025, compared with 12.7 gigawatts in 2019. The plan also promises refurbishment of public rental housing and schools to make them zero-energy, and transformation of urban areas into smart green cities.

The government has increased its financial support of residential and commercial rooftop solar energy markets to help the sectors withstand the COVID-19 crisis.

The Swiss government has increased financial support of its solar PV rebate scheme by $47 million. This means $387.6 million is now available in rebates for rooftop solar energy projects.

Switzerland recorded an increase in the number of residential consumers applying for rebates between 2018 and January 2020. Applications have declined over the past four months, a trend expected to continue due to the worsening pandemic. Authorities predict the situation would lead to failures in compensating for project costs without further financial support.

In September 2019, The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) completed an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze potential impacts of the programand proposed to lease the entire 1.57 acres of coastal plain for oil and gas leasing. Subsequently, on August 17, 2020, David Bernhardt, the Secretary of Interior, signed a record decision adopting the EIS recommendation and authorizing the program pursuant to TCJA. This action made the entire program area available for oil and gas leasing, leaving the Refuge vulnerable to future exploration, development, and transportation. On August 24, 2020, environmental and indigenous groups filed lawsuits claiming the federal government did not adequately comply with environmental laws requiring thorough impact assessments.
