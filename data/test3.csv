According to the Minister of the Environment Rene Koka, the green agreement will bring several opportunities for Estonia. ï¿½It is in our interest to move with innovation and find new perspectives for increasing the competitiveness of Estonian companies, increasing the volume of investments and opportunities for the transition to renewable energy. One important area for Estonia is the development of hydrogen and other renewable energy and fuel-based technologies. In my opinion, hydrogen is definitely one of the solutions of the future, and I believe that in ten years' time, hydrogen solutions could work very successfully both in Estonia and in Europe, ""said Kokk. Estonia supports the establishment of a long-term climate neutrality framework across the European Union in 2050 in European climate law. At the same time, increasing the European Union's 2030 climate target must be preceded by a thorough analysis of Member States and sectors. According to Estonia, the energy and transport sectors need the most investments, as it is important to ensure energy security and security of supply in the transition to climate neutrality. Estonia sees great potential, for example, in offshore wind farms, which is a good opportunity for greater use of renewable energy in the Nordic-Baltic region. There is also a need to support the development of innovative solutions, the development of green technologies and basic and applied research. The focus should also be on the implementation and use of future technologies and the development of the necessary skills. Estonia also emphasizes the importance of environmental education and the fact-based treatment of green issues. Estonia's position also points out that the initial European Green Agreement action plan published in December would also take into account the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. However, exit activities must be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals and the principles of the circular economy.

Experiences from implementing the Satoyama Initiative are clearly the first potential step toward designing a new society post-COVID-19. The idea of ""local production for local consumption"" is based on building 'face-to-face relationships' between producers and consumers, and reevaluating relationships with communities in which we live or to which we have close ties. This is done in practice through the Satoyama Initiative.
The practice of ""local production for local consumption"" will allow people living in the region to rethink their habits and the underlying environment and nurture environmental values. This buildup of value will lead to productive and strong local communities. Furthermore, strong local communities contribute not only to biodiversity conservation, but also various other priorities such as disaster risk reduction. For example, as the climate crisis intensify disasters, it is necessary to build societies that are resilient -- societies that can repair the damage caused and swiftly recover. To do so, strong community ties among residents built over day-to-day life are indispensable, in addition to employing nature-based solutions. To redesign socioeconomic systems through COVID-19 recovery, the three transitions of decarbonization, circular economy, and decentralization are critical.

The plan is one of President Moonï¿½s biggest economic initiatives since coming to power in 2017.

ï¿½ The Korean New Deal will involve a direct investment of KRW 114 trillion from the national treasury by 2025, which with funding from the private sector and local governments will rise to around KRW 160 trillion. Korea commits USD 60.9 billion (KRW 73.4 trillion / EUR 53.4 billion) to Green New Deal by 2025. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Green New Deal would create 659,000 jobs.

ï¿½ Breakdown of the commitment

   2. Low-carbon and decentralized energy supply - Investment of 35.8 trillion won including 24.3 trillion won from the treasury

This has been justified on the grounds that Switzerland's emission reduction strategy is centered upon increased use of rail and public transport, and therefore the industry needs to come out strong from the crisis.

The government will provide CHF1.275 billion to guarantee loans to airlines operating in Switzerland, and CHF600 million to support aviation companies at national airports. On August 26th, a 130 million loan to air traffic control company Skyguide.

Switzerland recorded an increase in the number of residential consumers applying for rebates between 2018 and January 2020. Applications have declined over the past four months, a trend expected to continue due to the worsening pandemic.

The government announces a massive infrastructure investment planï¿½conceptualised as part of the countryï¿½s strategy to revitalize the economy and reduce rampant unemployment. The COVID-19 pandemic and the downgrading of the economy already before the pandemic increased the urgent need for infrastructure investment. 
The ""greenness"" of the measure has not been explicitly defined. Among theï¿½sectors of intervention - energy, water and sanitation, transport,ï¿½digital infrastructure, human settlements,ï¿½and agriculture and agroprocessing, energy is the one that most explicitly refers to sustainable resources with the continuation of the Integrated Resource Plan (project started in 2019).

Cabinet approved key actions that will contribute to the environment:
1. Establishment of the Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission (PCCCC) to coordinate the Just Transition. One of its first tasks will be to focus on understanding the impact of climate change on jobs, both positive and negative, and climate change responses by sector and location. This will require the urgent finalisation of the National Employment Vulnerability Assessment (NEVA) and thereafter, Sector Job Resilient Plans (SJRPs). The Commission will also explore opportunities for new upstream and downstream green jobs and green industries that should be exploited, and climate resilience interventions that need to be expanded.
2. South Africaï¿½s Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS), also approved by Cabinet, will be deposited with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat. ï¿½This is further to the countryï¿½s NDC deposited with the UNFCCC ahead of the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in which countries committed to limited the increase in global average temperatures to below 1.5ï¿½C above pre-industrial levels.

This strategy is a revision and update of the 2011 strategy and builds on the successes and lessons from the implementation of that strategy. The NWMS 2020 is focused on preventing waste and diverting waste from landfill by leveraging the concept of the Circular Economy to drive sustainable, inclusive economic growth and development in the waste sector, while reducing the social and environmental impacts of waste.
